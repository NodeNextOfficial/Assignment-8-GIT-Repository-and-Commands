# NeedleFinder
The code searches for a file named "Needle.txt" in the user's home directory and its subdirectories ("Desktop", "Downloads", and "Documents").
If the file is found, the program outputs "Found the needle in [folder] folder!".
If the file is not found, the program outputs "Needle not found!".
The search ends once the file is found or all directories have been searched.
